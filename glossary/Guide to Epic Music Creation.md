# Guide to Epic Music Creation
I made a compilation of instructions that I use in Suno.ai. With them I like to create epic, tribal or cinematic songs in the style of Two Steps from the Hell. I hope this can be useful to someone…

[Poyato’s Guide to Complex Music Creation in Suno.ai V4](https://www.reddit.com/r/SunoAI/comments/1if74n5/guide_to_epic_music_creation/?show=original)

## 1. ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Essential Principles for Suno.ai

To gain maximum control over the AI, follow these guidelines:

- [x] Language: All tags and instructions must be in English, except for musical terms in Italian (e.g., Allegro, Presto, Adagio). 
- [x] Character Limits: ⁠
  - Style of Music: Maximum 200 characters.
  - Custom Lyrics: Maximum 3000 characters.
- [x] Main Fields: ⁠• ⁠Title – The song’s name.
  - ⁠Style of Music – Genre, instrumentation, atmosphere, and rhythm. ⁠• ⁠Lyrics – Song structure and detailed commands.
  - ⁠Finalization: Always include [Outro: Extended] and [End: Fade Out] to prevent abrupt endings.

## 2. Structuring the "Style of Music" Field

The Style of Music field defines the genre, instrumentation, atmosphere, and rhythm of the song. Follow this structured approach:

1. ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Main Genre and Style (e.g., Epic Orchestral, Dark Cinematic, Viking Chant)   
2. ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Primary Instrumentation (e.g., deep war drums, male choir, brass, strings)   
3. ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Atmosphere and Emotions (e.g., heroic, solemn, mysterious, triumphant)   
4. ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠BPM and Rhythm (e.g., tempo 78 BPM, march-like, intense build-up)   
5. ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Vocal Elements (e.g., solo contralto female voice, SATB male choir, shamanic chanting)   

Example Entry:
> Style of Music: Epic Orchestral; deep war drums, male choir, brass, strings; heroic, solemn, mysterious; tempo 78 BPM; intense, grandiose; solo contralto female voice.

## 3. Song Structure and Meta-Tags

Proper song structure ensures a coherent narrative flow.

Main Sections
> ⁠[Pre-Intro] – Atmospheric, abstract, or chaotic introduction.   
> ⁠[Intro] – Sets the song’s tone instrumentally.   
> [Verse] – Develops the story.   
> ⁠[Pre-Chorus] – Builds anticipation for the chorus.   
> ⁠[Chorus] – The most memorable, intense section.   
> [Bridge] – A transition with melodic variation.   
> [Instrumental Break] – A section of musical variation before the climax.   
> [Coda] – A dramatic or unexpected ending.   
> [Outro] – A grand or soft conclusion.   

Recommended tag order:

> Section > Vocal Type > Dynamics > Vocal Style > Vocal Quality > Instructions > Lyrics

Example:
> [Chorus, Full Orchestra, Choir]   
> [Dynamic: ff]   
> [Vocal Style: Male Choir, Deep and Powerful]   
> [Instructions: Build intensity, layered harmonies]   
> Lyrics: > “We march, we rise, we conquer!”   

## 4. Controlling Expressiveness and Mixing

Advanced Modifiers
> ⁠[Tempo Modifiers] (Accelerando, Ritardando, Rubato)   
> ⁠[Expression Dynamics] (Swelling Strings, Sudden Crescendo, Gradual Fade-out)   
> ⁠[Micro-Phrasing] (Subtle variations in articulation for realism)   
> ⁠[Stereo Placement] (Hard Left, Wide Stereo, Centered Vocals)   

Example:
> [Verse, Male Whispered Vocals, Low Strings]   
> [Expression Dynamics: Swelling Strings]   
> [Stereo Placement: Whispered Vocals Hard Left, Strings Wide Stereo]   
> [Instructions: Subtle volume build-up, haunting effect]   

## 5. Vocal Techniques and Choirs

Beyond the already covered techniques, these additional layers improve vocal quality and choir depth.

Vocal Expressiveness
> ⁠[Breath Control] (Heavy Breathing, Whispered Breath, Smooth Exhale)   
> ⁠[Dynamic Choir Sections] (Solo Tenor → Full Choir Crescendo)   
> ⁠[Extended Vocal Techniques] (Fry Scream, Throat Singing, Kulning)   

Example:
> [Chorus, Thunderous Choir, Dramatic Brass]   
> [Dynamic Choir Sections: Solo Baritone → Full Choir Explosion]   
> [Extended Vocal Techniques: Kulning in Final Notes]   

## 6. Advanced Use of Effects

Sound Effects and Mixing
> [Effect: Reverb] (Deep Cathedral, Plate, Gated)   
> [Effect: Granular Synthesis] (Creates glitchy, atmospheric effects)   
> ⁠[Effect: Stereo Panning] (Vocals move left to right for immersive experience)   
> ⁠[Effect: Exponential Decay Reverb] (Simulates deep epic environments)   

Example:
> [Outro, Choir, Distant War Drums]   
> [Effect: Deep Cathedral Reverb]   
> [Effect: Exponential Decay Reverb on Choir]   
> [Instructions: Create a mystical, fading effect, as if voices are dissolving into eternity.]

## 7. Writing More Natural and Impactful Lyrics

Avoid Generic Words and Clichés

Avoid common AI-generated words like: dreams, heart, soul, sky, rain, light, fly, free, love, fire, bright, tonight, moment, ready

Use more unique words instead:
tempest, clan, oath, harbor, shadows, echo, veil, ancient, murmur

## 8. Using Double Asterisks (**) and the ">" Symbol

- ⁠Double Asterisk (\*\*text**) → For emphasis, dramatic pauses, or key impact words.
- Greater-than symbol (>) → Introduces choir lines or secondary interjections.
- Combined (> \*\*text**) → When the choir makes a strong statement or interjection.

Example:
> Beware the daughter of the sea, Beware, beware of \*\*me!** (dramatic pause, emphasis on “me”)    
> Beware… the daughter… of the sea! (choir echo)   
> \*\*“Stood aside!”** (strong choir interjection)

## Conclusion

🔥 Now you have the ultimate guide to crafting epic, tribal, and cinematic music with absolute AI control! 🔥
